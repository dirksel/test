<h1 class="page-title">About Learn.js</h1>
<p>The <i>Learn.js</i> book series is highly inspired by the <a href="https://leanpub.com/manifesto" target="_blank">lean publishing model</a>. Each book is released early to get feedback from you so that together we can make the best books about JavaScript possible.</p>

<p>Updates are released regularly until each book is feature complete at v1.0.0. Help determine what it will mean for a book to be feature complete by letting us know which development tools, libraries, and programming patterns you'd be most interested in seeing covered. Email <a href="mailto:hi@learnjs.io">hi@learnjs.io</a>.</p>
