## Making 2D JavaScript Games
### You want to learn the best JavaScript tools for making 2D games. Get started with Making 2D JavaScript Games.

Learn to develop 2d games with javascript using a wide range of JavaScript tools and modules available via [npm](http://npmjs.org).

Many javascript game / animation library I've found bundle things like requestAnimationFrame polyfill, gameloop, entities, abstract drawing methods, keyboard/mouse input, vector math, and more into one entangled library. If I don't like how the library handles just one of those components, I'm stuck with dead library weight, and sometimes it's difficult to replace a library's methods.

Let's break down these components into separate pieces, learn what's available already on npm that we can use to build 2d games, and experiment with different approaches to building javascript games.

Let's use the node.js module system and code patterns to build small, reusable game modules and use them to make fun 2d games.

### Who is this book for?
The ideal reader for this book is someone who likes exploring, imagining, and inventing for themselves. You probably have some experience with javascript already, and you'd like to learn more about animation using the canvas tag, basic game development patterns, and gain intermediate skills in developing javascript modules that can be used on the server and in the browser.
