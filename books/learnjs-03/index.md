## Learn.js #3
### Mapping with leaflet.js.

_I'm releasing this book a few chapters at a time in part to get feedback from you about what topics you'd like to see in the book. Buy it now and you'll get all updates for free! You'll also be able to help guide the direction of the book by requesting content additions and providing feedback._

[Leaflet.js](http://leafletjs.com/) is an awesome, easy to learn mapping library. In this book we’ll go through some introductory examples so you can get started using it in your projects. We'll also use data from various public sources like open government data, social networks and geographically-aware wiki to create interactive maps.

We'll be using Leaflet.js as a module in the node.js/CommonJS style, utilizing browserify to bundle the code for the browser. We'll also explore a wide range of tilesets available for use in Leaflet.js maps.

### The reader
The ideal reader for this book is someone who likes exploring, imagining, and inventing for themselves. You probably have some experience with javascript already, and you'd like to learn more about animation using the canvas tag, basic game development patterns, and gain intermediate skills in developing javascript modules that can be used on the server and in the browser.

### The book covers:
- The basics of creating maps with Leaflet.js.
- Creating interactive, filterable maps.
- Using alternate tilesets and image overlays with your maps.
- Integrating maps with public APIs and datasets.
- Using browserify to bundle node.js-style modules for the browser.
- Intermediate node.js module creation and best practices.
