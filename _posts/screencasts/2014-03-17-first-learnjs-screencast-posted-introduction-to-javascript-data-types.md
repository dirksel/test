The first screencast is a very basic introduction to JavaScript data types: strings, numbers, arrays, objects, & booleans, as well as equality operators and an overview of the Chrome JavaScript console.

I'm starting very simple with these screencasts, and in future updates I'll cover git, GitHub, npm, node.js, advanced JavaScript topics and various JavaScript libraries.
