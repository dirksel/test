## npm recipes

npm recipes is a collection of tutorials that combine modules from npm to build projects.

If you haven't already, you should make sure to download the free book npm recipes here: [gumroad.com/l/npm-recipes](https://gumroad.com/l/npm-recipes)

## screencasts

There's also this set of 10 screencasts recorded over the summer of 2014: [gumroad.com/l/summer-2014-screencasts](https://gumroad.com/l/summer-2014-screencasts)

It includes video tutorials for basic JavaScript, node.js & express, making 2d games, leveldb, leaflet.js, and more.

## Pay what you feel

I've made these available for free, & it would mean a lot to me if you added a tip to pay what you feel the projects are worth. Even $5 makes a huge difference in keeping the Learn.js adventure alive.
