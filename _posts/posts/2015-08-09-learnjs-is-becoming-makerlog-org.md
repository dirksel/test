Over the next few weeks learnjs.io will become [makerlog.org](http://makerlog.org). The new site already exists, and the transition will be gradual. This is an exciting change for me, and I hope you'll stick around to enjoy all the upcoming awesome.

## Why?
**The simple reason:** writing only about JavaScript gets old.

**The more complicated reason:** over the past year I started [Civic Maker Lab](http://civicmakerlab.com) a company focused on creating tools for journalists & community organizers. Part of that work is focused on software & part on education. The content of learnjs.io is relevant to that work, but it would fit better under a more broad name & mission: makerlog.org.

## What will be on this new blog?
I love JavaScript, Node.js, npm, and related topics, but I'm wildly excited about expanding the topic areas that I write about. Expect posts related to code, art, robots, & the people behind those things. I plan to cover open source software, technology that supports civic engagement, community organizing, & the mad science of citizens.

## What about the books?
You may have noticed I've taken a break from the [Learn.js books](http://learnjs.io/books/). The main reason for that has been my focus on a project called [Flatsheet](http://flatsheet.io), a tool for managing data as editorial content. Flatsheet is open source software that has received support from two grants. The current grant period is ending this month, so I plan to do more book releases starting in September. Expect most of the books to get a massive makeover!

## What's next?
There are a few main changes you'll notice:

- The newsletter will be renamed to _makerlog_
- The twitter account is already renamed to @themakerlog
- Posts will be appearing at [makerlog.org](http://makerlog.org)
- New types of content will be included: interviews, screencasts, podcasts, live blogs, streaming, etc.
- The Learn.js books will be re-released by Civic Maker Lab, with improved, expanded content. If you've already purchased a book you'll still get any updates for free.
