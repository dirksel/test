For months I've been working on a new Learn.js project: a way to subscribe to new books & screencasts as well as all updates.

I finally have an early version up at [subscribe.learnjs.io](https://subscribe.learnjs.io/users/sign_up?coupon=v8nf6h7d)!

To subscribe it's $12 per month, and you'll get access to all 6 Learn.js books, as well as any new books we release, and all updates to existing books. You'll also get access to the weekly screencasts that will start being released on <b>Monday, March 17</b>! If you subscribe now you'll be among the first to

## The books you'll have access to as a subscriber:
- npm recipes
- Theming with Ghost
- Development Environments for Beginners
- Introduction to JavaScript & Node.js
- Making 2d Games with Node.js & Browserify
- Mapping with Leaflet.js

## The screencast plan:
I'll start by posting screencasts about setting up a JavaScript development environment & basics of the language, then move on to more advanced topics and library usage examples.

Use this url to get the first month free: [https://subscribe.learnjs.io/users/sign_up?coupon=v8nf6h7d](https://subscribe.learnjs.io/users/sign_up?coupon=v8nf6h7d)

Consecutive months will be billed at $12/month.

## Have ideas for screencast topics?
I'd love to hear about what topics you'd like to see covered in the screencasts. Email me at hi@seattle.io with suggestions!
