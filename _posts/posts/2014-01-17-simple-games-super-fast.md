Check out this simple implementation of pong I made in a few hours last night: [sethvincent.github.io/digital-table-tennis-for-two](http://sethvincent.github.io/digital-table-tennis-for-two)

It's made using [crtrdg.js](http://crtrdg.com), a 2d toolkit for making games that leverages [browserify](http://browserify.org) for writing node-style javascript modules for the browser.

Here's the source on GitHub: [github.com/sethvincent/digital-table-tennis-for-two](http://github.com/sethvincent/digital-table-tennis-for-two).

It turns out I’ve been experimenting with making silly games for about a year!

At this time last year making even a dumb little game was a struggle. Yesterday I made a pong rip-off in a few hours. I’m happy about that.

I made this pong game as a quick warm-up for a "gaming for good" game jam I'm attending this weekend. A chance to test my tools to make sure everything is working properly. crtrdg.js is working well for me as a rapid prototyping tool. I learned to program with Processing, and that's informed some of my decisions in creating crtrdg.js.

I find that crtrdg.js works pretty great for game jams – quick projects where the stakes are low and the goal is to get an idea out fast. 

Here's a post about what I learned from participating in Ludum Dare, an awesome game jam that inspired me to first start participating in that kind of event: [What I learned from Ludum Dare 27](http://superbigtree.tumblr.com/post/59937961490/what-i-learned-from-ludum-dare-27).

Also check out this post that shows example usage of crtrdg.js: [Creating animations with javascript, the canvas tag, and crtrdg.js](http://superbigtree.tumblr.com/post/62030587562/creating-animations-with-javascript-the-canvas-tag).

### Learn.js book series updates.

I'll be including a chapter on how to make pong in the next update to the Learn.js book on 2d games. The next update will happen before the end of January.

[Pre-order the 2d games book for $15](http://gum.co/learnjs02) or the [4-book bundle of the Learn.js series for $38](http://gum.co/bundle01) to get updates as they are released.
