It's a secret. That's what I really like about JavaScript. It's a secret hidden in plain sight. It's magic that powers a wide range of sites, glue that binds our online actions to a website's functionality.

People regularly use websites without looking at or thinking about JavaScript, but it's there. Almost always, it's there.

I realized later that my interest in the world wide web could be described in the same way. I love learning about things that are ubiquitous, taken for granted, and yet powerful.

So how about you? What keeps you interested in learning JavaScript?

What keeps you from giving up when bugs abound, code doesn't have documentation, or words are blending together from lack of sleep?

Here are some responses from the Learn.js newsletter:

"It's so much easier for me to publish an app I made with Javascript than with other languages." - [Ifeanyi Oraelosi](https://plus.google.com/u/4/+IfeanyiOraelosi/posts)

"I think the magic comes from the true reach of the language. I have built websites, applications, tools, servers, databases, and even robots all with the same programming language. Things written in other languages can even be compiled to JS to bring things such as 3D game engines into the browser. How crazy is that!" - [Jeff Ward](https://twitter.com/jeffscottward)

"What keeps me interested in learning JS is all the more senior devs I'm meeting who are willing to lend me a hand. The community is amazing!" - [Joanne Daudier](https://twitter.com/jdaudier)
