It's a secret. That's what I really like about JavaScript. It's a secret hidden in plain sight. It's magic that powers a wide range of sites, glue that binds our online actions to a website's functionality.

People regularly use websites without looking at or thinking about JavaScript, but it's there. Almost always, it's there.

I realized later that my interest in the world wide web could be described in the same way. I love learning about things that are ubiquitous, taken for granted, and yet powerful.

So how about you? What keeps you interested in learning JavaScript?

What keeps you from giving up when bugs abound, code doesn't have documentation, or words are blending together from lack of sleep?

Talk with me on twitter at [@learnjs_io](http://twitter.com/learnjs_io) or email hi@learnjs.io.
